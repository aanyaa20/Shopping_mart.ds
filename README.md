# Shopping_mart.ds
The main objective of the shopping cart system is to manage the details of the cart, orders, Payment, Customer, and Category and reduce the manual work. The project is built at the administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed access to change and remove items. The customer can view the shops (brands) with the articles, prices, and quantities available for purchase. After a successful purchase, a bill is generated which is to be paid.
